        <h2>I came to the research world after years of living and working in Free Culture and Open Source, and started asking a simple question:</h2>
		<h2>What would happen if our qualitative research projects were open projects?</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Radically Transparent Research</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
				<p>...is an approach to qualitative research inspired by the radical realtime transparency practices of open communities such as Free and Open Source software, hardware, and content projects. It results in public and collaboratively constructed artifacts with the potential to broaden awareness of and participation in research while creating a compendium of stories that can be shared with practitioners looking to reflect on and transform their own practices.</p>

	<section class="slide" ><div>
		<h2>What would happen if we bestowed specific freedoms upon the people our research touches?</h2>
        <ol>
			<li>Freedom to use the data for any purpose</li>
			<li>Freedom to share the data with any person</li>
			<li>Freedom to analyze and transform the data</li>
			<li>Freedom to share your analysis and transformations</li>
		</ol>

	</div></section>

		<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>We'd default to open.</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
				<p>We'd make the data open. We'd make the analysis publicly available and open to anyone who wants to participate, not having a delineation saying “these are the official people” on the project and “these are not.” The steps are tiny and not too far from current practice, but when we compare them to the conventional practices for qualitative research, the implications of the little change pieces lining up start piling and piling and piling.</p>

		<h2>Step 0: IRB</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide" ><div>
        <h2>Ethical practice of radically transparent research is actually quite straightforward.</h2>
		<h2>Radical transparency simply becomes part of the procedure you ask your participants to consent to.</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>These procedures are normal.</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
				<p>I'm asking my participants to get up on stage and give a talk.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>My participants will perform at Carnegie Hall and have their performances broadcast on the radio.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>My study involves writing columns for a nationally syndicated newspaper.</p>
			</blockquote>
		</figure>
		<p>As long as people know what they're doing and consent to it, it's fine.</p>
	</div></section>
	
	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>You should tell participants...</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>They're engaging in a type of public performance.</li>
			<li>The data is going into a public, open dataset.</li>
			<li>They <em>won't</em> be anonymous; others will know the data comes from them.</li>
			<li>They'll have the chance to check and edit their data before it becomes part of that public, open dataset.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>(Once you create an open dataset, you've cleared the way for other researchers following you to use that data IRB-exempt.)</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide shout"><div>
		<h2>Step 1: Collect the data.</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>This all happens the normal way.</h2>
        <p>You can select and recruit your participants as you would for any other research project, design your interview prompts and conduct your interview as you would for any other research project, take notes and transcribe your interview as you would for any other research project, member-check as you would for any other research project...</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>...and if you want, you can use realtime transcription and grounded indigenous coding (optional).</h2>
        <p><strong>Realtime transcription</strong> services like CART (Communication Access Realtime Transcription) allow participants to view, analyze, and edit data <em>during and immediately after</em> an interview, leading to <em>coding</em> (a form of analysis) that is both <em>grounded</em> in a concrete artifact and <em>indigenous</em> to the data collection process. <strong>Grounded indigenous coding</strong> is a rich mode of collaborative reflection.</em> 
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Q: Is grounded indigenous coding data collection, coding, analysis, or member-checking?</h2>
        <h2>A: Yes.</h2>
        <p>For more information on grounded indigenous coding, see <a href="http://radicallytransparentresearch.org/grounded-indigenous-coding">http://radicallytransparentresearch.org/grounded-indigenous-coding</a>.
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>How do I arrange realtime transcription?</h2>
        <p>The same way you'd arrange for an interpreter during an interview. Disability resource centers of many colleges and universities can put you in touch with trained transcription providers.</p>
        <p>For more information on arranging a realtime transcription interview, see <a href="http://radicallytransparentresearch.org/realtime-transcription">http://radicallytransparentresearch.org/realtime-transcription</a>.
    </div></section>

	<section class="slide shout"><div>
		<h2>Step 2: Open up the data.</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>What happens here:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Give your participant full copyright of their data.</li>
            <li>Have them edit their data until they end up with a version they're comfortable going public with.</li>
            <li>Have them assign an open license to that version.</li>
        </ol>
		<h2>This part of the process is about protecting and empowering your participants.</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Assigning copyright</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>[Interviewer]</strong> hereby irrevocably transfers and assigns to <strong>[interviewee]</strong> in perpetuity, all right (whether now known or hereinafter invented), title, and interest, throughout the world, including any copyrights and renewals or extensions thereto, in the attached transcript of the interview recorded between us on <strong>[date]</strong> in <strong>[location]</strong>.</p>
			</blockquote>
		</figure>
        <p> Simply say these lines on the recording, or write and sign them. More detail at <a href="http://radicallytransparentresearch.org/assigning-copyright">http://radicallytransparentresearch.org/assigning-copyright</a>.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <p>The participant now owns their data, and the researcher can't do anything with that data without permission. <em>The usual power dynamic has been flipped.</em></p>
        <p>The next step is for the participant to edit their data so that it becomes something they're comfortable releasing publicly. Ask them to look over the transcript and see if there's anything they would like to take out or correct.  
</p>
	</div></section>

		<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Cues you might hear:</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Oh geez, I didn't mean to say that.</p>
			<blockquote>
			</blockquote>
				<p>I don't want people to know I was talking about <em>them</em>.</p>
			<blockquote>
			</blockquote>
                <p>I'm the only person in the country who does that.</p>
			</blockquote>
		</figure>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Editing strategies</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Take out a sensitive sentence or phrase.</li>
			<li>Generalize or pseudonymize names. "Some students at my university..."</li>
			<li>Leave in a tricky passage, but annotate it. "I understand why they needed to do that, but I guess I was really frustrated here."</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It's often surprising how <em>little</em> people edit their transcripts -- they are aware from the start that they're telling public stories, which often makes them conscious of the nature of their performativity.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Choosing a license</h2>
		<p>Once your participant is comfortable with their transcript, they can choose an open content license for it. They retain copyright while granting others permission to use the data in certain ways.</p>
        <p>We recommend a Creative Commons license like the one pictured on the next page, which allows sharing and remixing for all uses. For more information, including a license selection tool, see <a href="http://radicallytransparentresearch.org/choosing-a-license">http://radicallytransparentresearch.org/choosing-a-license</a>.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide cover"><div>
		<img src="pictures/eavesdrop-8.jpg" alt="">
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Wait... won't I get "scooped"?</h2>
        <p>No. Open licensing allows people to share <em>and</em> remix the data as long as they give credit to the original creators in a way that is traceable back to the original source and author. You can specify the way you would like your work to be cited.</p>
        <p>If you like, you can chose a license with a <em>share-alike</em> clause, which requires works that utilize your work to be similarly open-licensed.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Applying a license</h2>
        <p>To apply a license to a work, add this (or similar text) to a document (often at the start or end).</p>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
            </blockquote>
        </figure>
		<p>This work is released under the following license: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0</a>. You are free to share and remix the work as long as you cite it in the following way: <strong>[citation]</strong></p>
	</div></section>

		<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Conventional consent forms:</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
                <p>I'm going to take 2 hours of your valuable time.  We're going to have a conversation, and then the artifact of that conversation will come back into a black box locked in the bottom of the sea where it will never see the light of day again.</p>
   			</blockquote>
		</figure>
		<h2>So what did you just spend that time for?</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>I mean, it was nice to have that conversation.</h2>
        <p>You're contributing to knowledge. But there's nothing really that your subjects can take away from it and bring to people. They can’t say “I just had a really cool conversation about public schools, and...”</p>
    <p>Well, they can, but they have nothing to <em>show</em> others. Licensing the data is a step that empowers participants  to control and take that data and use it for their own ends and means.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>We don't usually consider ownership.</h2>
        <p>Because we don't usually license or assign copyright of interviews, it's unclear who owns the right to that data.</p>
        <p>This makes it hard to go back years later and say “that was a really cool study, can I use your data to continue it?” So we don't do <em>that</em> either. But if we set up clarity about ownership and licensing up front, reviving projects becomes easier in the future. Maybe we'd do it more often if it weren't so hard.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide shout"><div>
		<h2>Step 3: Analyze the data.</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <p>The next slide shows what happens to the data during the process of analysis. Moving from left to right:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The raw transcript is generated.</li>
            <li>The transcript is edited. After a 1-week timeout, the edited transcript and any initial annotations go public. In the meantime, the original raw transcript is discarded.</li>
            <li>All subsequent annotations and analysis are automatically and immediately public.</li>
        </ol>
	</div></section>

    <section class="slide cover"><div>
		<img src="pictures/eavesdrop-11.jpg" alt="">
	</div></section>

    <section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Did you notice?</h2>
        <p>This is the analysis section, and yet we're talking about data collection, member-checking, <em>and</em> what qualitative researchers would conventionally call "analysis." As mentioned earlier during our discussion on <em>grounded indigenous coding</em>, we usually think of these steps as distinct -- but they're really part of the same process.</p>
        <p>Any analysis methods, theories, codes, etc. may be used for radically transparent research projects.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>A good question:</h2>
        <p>We now have an incredibly dynamic dataset; people can edit data or add to it, and it's changing all the time. How do you manage having analysis of the content while the content is changing? How do you make sure people are not "messing" with your data?</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide" ><div>
		<h2>Answer: we set arbitrary boundaries and freezes in our data, just like we already do.</h2>
        <p>How else do you think researchers differentiate between "data collection" and "member-checking" and "analysis"? We decide when one phase ends and another begins; we say, consciously or unconsciously, "my data's finished and now I'll only work on the annotation layer."</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <p>So yes -- when you feel you're reading, take a snapshot of the data; leave with your copy. (In open source parlance, this is called <em>forking</em>.)<p>
        <p>This doesn't prevent others from evolving their own versions of that data, and they don't prevent you from doing anything with yours.</p>
		<h2>Don't be afraid to draw a line and say “stop changing!"</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide shout"><div>
		<h2>Step 4: Disseminate.</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide" ><div>
		<h2>Dissemination, analysis, and collection are the same thing.</h2>
        <p>With radical transparency, what we're trying to disseminate is the process of analysis itself. There's plenty of research showing that change, especially educational change, doesn't happen by spewing journal papers out to people.  It changes through one-to-one contact, through dialogue, through participation.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide" ><div>
		<h2>The people that are most changed by research projects are the ones participating in it.</h2>
        <p>So if you want more people to change as a result of your research project, get them to participate in your research project.</p>
        <p>This is where mentoring, partnership, and access to ongoing projects and conversations is critical.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Transparency is not a magic wand.</h2>
        <p>If you build it, they <em>might</em> come. Even if you're extraordinarily transparent, that doesn't guarantee people will show up to help. But they might -- they <em>can</em>. It's easier for them to do it, and it's easier for you to ask them.</p>
        <p>So you'll probably ask them more. And they'll probably step up more. It's about gently unlocking unknown possibilities.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide shout"><div>
		<h2>Step 1-2-3-4: Collect, open, analyze, and transform... the research community.</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide shout"><div>
		<h2>Hint: You're already doing this.</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Radical transparency does not require massive transformation of your reserach practices.</h2>
        <p>There are just some very small minor changes in what we've done in the process, but it started opening up a couple of very interesting possibilities. They may not go anywhere, but they could go somewhere that we've just not imagined before.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide" ><div>
		<h2>Do we need to transform the way we do qualitative research so it encompasses practices beyond the conventional?</h2>
        <p>I got this question from an audience member who was surprised at how "conventional" radically transparent research was. Couldn't we do <em>different</em> things, they asked? Letters to the editor, magazine articles, social media -- wasn't that participation also a form of research?</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <p>I happen to think they are. But I don't necessarily think of radical transparency as a new way of <em>doing</em> qualitative research.  I think of it as a slightly different way of <em>seeing</em> -- and thinking about <em>sharing</em> -- the research we’re <em>already doing</em>.</p>
        <p>The insight my colleague had was that the term "qualitative research" encompasses way more activity than what we normally put in that box. And I do want to point out that we <em>can</em> make that box bigger, put different things in that box.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <p>But you don't <em>have</em> to move your research outside that existing box.  You can use the same procedures you’re already using. Doing radically transparent research does not mean you need to stop writing journal papers and sign up for all sorts of social media accounts. It simply means that whatever you <em>are</em> doing, other people can see.</p>
        <h2>You are already doing research that could be radically transparent. What would happen if you defaulted to open?</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide shout"><div>
		<h2>Limitations</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Radical transparency is not appropriate for all research projects.</h2>
        <p>You should be <em>very</em> careful using it with some groups -- children, vulnerable populations. You should be <em>very</em> careful using it with some topics: things that could someone's life, health, family, career.</p>
        <p>There are many research questions, areas, and techniques where we <em>need</em> privacy, secrecy, anonymity, and confidentiality.</em></p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide" ><div>
		<h2>However, plenty of qualitative research is done with consenting adults telling stories they would love to share.</h2>
        <p>In my own field (engineering education), we interview practicing engineers, adult students, teachers -- people whose stories don't get shared not because the stories are too private, but because the people are too busy. How about yours?</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide shout"><div>
		<h2>Possibility: Decoupling.</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide" ><div>
        <p>The next image shows how we work with our data right now. It's tightly bundled together -- a research project is a dataset that gets analyzed and then prepared into some final product (usually a paper) for dissemination. The same team -- or even individual -- is usually responsible for all three things.</p>
        <h2>What else could this look like?</h2>
	</div></section>

    <section class="slide cover"><div>
		<img src="pictures/eavesdrop-19.jpg" alt="">
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide" ><div>
        <h2>What if we decoupled these things?</h2>
        <p>What if data sets and analysis materials were treated as separate from publications? What if we thought of ourselves as able to use and remix each other's work, each other's data and analyses -- and we were legally allowed to do that thanks to open licensing?</p>
	</div></section>

    <section class="slide cover"><div>
		<img src="pictures/eavesdrop-20.jpg" alt="">
	</div></section>


		<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>We usually say this...</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
                <p>I wrote my thesis and defended my thesis, and turned that dissertation into 2 journal papers, with another in review. They've since been cited by 3 other researchers.</p>
   			</blockquote>
		</figure>
	</div></section>

		<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>...what if we could also say this?</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
                <p>Also, research groups at 2 other institutions are extending -- and citing -- my dataset, since they're drawing upon that for their work. Another colleague is using -- and citing -- my analysis. I’m getting more citations because I’m sharing more things.</p>
   			</blockquote>
		</figure>
	</div></section>


	<section class="slide" ><div>
		<h2>People are able to use your work more; you're able to get credit for that. It's a win-win situation.</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>We're making our existing process more granular.</h2>
        <p>By decoupling data from analysis from final dissemination outputs, we make it smaller, lighter, and faster to share all of these smaller pieces with less baggage. There's no reason why all these things need to be bundled as tightly as they are.</p>
        <p>They're all the same parts we already have. We’re just starting to separate them.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide shout"><div>
		<h2>Possibility: A Scholarship of Collegiality.</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Boyer's 4 Types of Scholarship</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Discovery</li>
            <li>Integration</li>
            <li>Application</li>
            <li>Teaching</li>
            <li><strong>Collegiality</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Dr. Monica Cox proposed a 5th type: collegiality. A scholarship that empowers other people to do the things they want to do.</p>
    </div></section>

    <section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>We really do mean people, not just researchers.</h2>
        <p>Remember, participants are taking home their transcripts.  They may share them with other people and look at things from the other participants. There's activity from those who would normally not be involved in the research process, people who don't typically see behind the scenes. We don't know what kind of activity that might be. We might never get to see it... and that's okay too. We'll never know unless we let people surprise us.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
        <p>Think of an iceberg. There's a little group of people at the top -- the researchers we know and can see. Then there's a bigger chunk, the ice under the water. These are the masses of people who participate in research, and maybe researchers we don't know quite so well, people outside our field.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide" ><div>
    <h2>Then there's the ocean. This massive group of people who don't know what's going on at all.</h2>
		<h2>How can you participate in a conversation you've never heard before?</h2>
	</div></section>

		<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Why do you think we get these sorts of questions?</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
                <p>What does that mean? What are you doing? Why would you do that? How do you do that? Why do you think it's cool? How does it affect other people?</p>
   			</blockquote>
		</figure>
        <p>Let's open up our black boxes. Let's bring more of our activity to the surface. Let's expose our process to other people, especially people different from us.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>A colleague's comment:</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
                <p>[This] gets into a power differential that is quite powerful - the researcher/subject relationship is different... both ["researcher" and "subject"] are researcher [and] participant - it doesn't necessarily enable someone to talk about something sensitive - but it changes ideas about who gets to talk, who gets to have an opinion, laying yourself open to putting yourself in the "subject" role.</p>
   			</blockquote>
		</figure>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <p>When you get all these people in the room watching each other play and tumble and think and argue and question and poke, you're immediately hit by the realization that the same thing can look very different to different people. We "know" this already, but there’s a difference between knowing it and <em>seeing</em> it in front of us. Having that combination of novices and experts, and lurkers and doers, and letting people jump from looking into participation whenever they want, allows people -- including us --  to flip back and forth between all these different viewpoints.</p>
	</div></section>

		<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>You start seeing different things.</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
                <p>Oh, they didn't catch that -- maybe I should clarify it.</p>
   			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
                <p>I thought this part of the data was useless, but <em>they</em> seem to be getting value from it, so perhaps I should look at it again.</p>
   			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
                <p>Wait, how did they come up with <em>that</em> conclusion?</p>
   			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
                <p><em>Interesting...</em></p>
   			</blockquote>

            <h2>My subjects started saying things that surprised me.</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
                <p>Wait -- does that mean that everyone else you're talking to... I can go see their stuff also? I'm going to go do that.</p>
   			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
                <p>Next time you see this person, can you ask them this question?</p>
   			</blockquote>
		</figure>
            <p>The data started talking to itself. The <em>people</em> started talking with each other, across time and space and topics.</p>
    	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Researchers are privileged.</h2>
        <p>We can plunge into data and experiences and we’ll instantly be thinking of different theories, citations, projects, contacts. That fluency is one of the great joys of being a scholar.</p>
        <p>How did we develop this fluency? We came to graduate school and saw others making these connections, learned by watching and doing. Radical transparency is a way to put ourselves in a fishbowl and let other people see us in this space.</p>

		<h2>We are creating spaces where knowledge can be held by a community... that anyone can join.</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>We create situated learning.</h2>
        <p>We have knowledge being visibly constructed and shared in community via <strong>cognitive apprenticeships</strong>. Participants in these projects get to see how research projects evolve from start to finish, and they also get to see how researchers evolve -- they get to see newcomers learning, more experienced people working with their expertise in that space, and over time they see those newcomers become more and more experienced.

        <h2>It's almost like letting the world come to grad school.</h2>
        <p>It’s almost like they get to see a little bit of grad school without having to go to grad school, which is a big deal because most of the people we work with are not going to be full-time researchers. They're going to be other types of people who move the world forward.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>...but grad school isn't the point.</h2>
        <p>It’s not so much grad school I care about per se, but the sort of deep involvement and critical thought around research that goes on here, and I’m hoping that radically transparent projects will make it easier for more people to get involved with that.</p>

            <h2>Do these thoughts sound familiar?</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
                <p>...the first steps on this journey do not feel like progress. The voice diminishes in volume... the inner voice turns critical; it tells them their ideas may be stupid. [Learners] at this position think before they speak... they speak in measured tones. Often, they do not speak at all. But this is not a passive silence; on the other side of this silence, <strong>reason is stirring.</strong></p>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>What makes people feel like they can do things?</h2>
        <p>There's an idea called <em>self-efficacy</em>, the belief that you <em>can</em> do something. If you have not yet done that thing, the <em>most influential factor</em> in building that belief is <em>watching someone like you do it and succeed</em>.</p>
        <p>By being radically transparent, we are letting people see us -- and many others -- look like them. And do research. And succeed -- with all the struggles and interim failures that are so much a part of that success.</p>
	</div></section>

		<section class="slide"><div>
            <h2>Sometimes I hear things like this:</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
                <p>The transparency stuff is great, but it isn't really necessary.  Anyone can find out what I'm doing.  Anyone can come up to me and ask for my papers, ask to help with my project, and I'd be more than happy to help them.</p>
   			</blockquote>
		</figure>
		<h2>Technically, that's true. But how many people have actually asked?</h2>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Think back to your early days as a novice researcher.</h2>
        <p>How much courage and confidence would it take for us to walk up to a strange person and say “You have no idea who I am but I want to help with your research”? How many of us asked that?</p>
        <p>And we’re privileged and educated and <em>already wanted to become researchers</em>. Most people have an even bigger hesitation barrier.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Besides, do you even have time to ask?</h2>
        <p>Even in my department, we complain that the only way we find out what the people <em>in the office next door</em> are doing is when we hear them talk at conferences. We don't find out otherwise. There's no way to eavesdrop. We don't have the time or the opportunity to track down every single person and find out what they're up to.</p>
        <p>So we don't have these kinds of conversations often.</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>It's an activation energy barrier. Transparency is a catalyst.</h2>
        <p>If you’re closed by default and opening upon request, it takes a lot of energy to make a request. If you’re open by default, nobody has to make a request, and because that energy isn't being used to get up the courage to ask, that energy gets used to do interesting things with your projects. It's throwing a catalyst into your reagent.</p>

		<section class="slide"><div>
            <h2>It's important for us to tell newcomers...</h2>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
                <p>...confirmation and community are <em>prerequisites</em> rather than <em>consequences</em> of development.</p>
   			</blockquote>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Don't put up unnecessary hurdles.</h2>
        <p>Coming to school is a hurdle. Making a login is a hurdle. Reading English, having internet access -- these are all hurdles, and some we can remove more easily than others, but at the very least, don’t put hurdles up if you don’t need to. If you don’t need a login to use the system, don’t require a login just because you want precise data on usage statistics. Do they have to email you? Do they have to be on-site at this time? Why <em>shouldn’t</em> students be able to participate?</p>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Open the door.</h2>
        <p>Say “hey, come join us!” instead of “if you want to join us, you must pass through these hurdles before you will be good enough.” How can we confirm the largest possible community for our research and tell them they belong here from the start? What can I do in <em>my own projects</em> to invite more people in?</p>
        <p>If we want a larger and more vibrant scholarly universe, we need to always ask ourselves that question.</em>
